Regarding our inclusion of PyCrypto (https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/):
        Copyright and licensing of the Python Cryptography Toolkit ("PyCrypto"):
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Previously, the copyright and/or licensing status of the Python
        Cryptography Toolkit ("PyCrypto") had been somewhat ambiguous. The
        original intention of Andrew M. Kuchling and other contributors has
        been to dedicate PyCrypto to the public domain, but that intention was
        not necessarily made clear in the original disclaimer (see
        LEGAL/copy/LICENSE.orig).

        Additionally, some files within PyCrypto had specified their own
        licenses that differed from the PyCrypto license itself. For example,
        the original RIPEMD.c module simply had a copyright statement and
        warranty disclaimer, without clearly specifying any license terms.
        (An updated version on the author's website came with a license that
        contained a GPL-incompatible advertising clause.)

        To rectify this situation for PyCrypto 2.1, the following steps have
        been taken:

         1. Obtaining explicit permission from the original contributors to
            dedicate their contributions to the public domain if they have not
            already done so. (See the "LEGAL/copy/stmts" directory for
            contributors' statements.)

         2. Replacing some modules with clearly-licensed code from other
            sources (e.g. the DES and DES3 modules were replaced with new ones
            based on Tom St. Denis's public-domain LibTomCrypt library.)

         3. Replacing some modules with code written from scratch (e.g. the
            RIPEMD and Blowfish modules were re-implemented from their
            respective algorithm specifications without reference to the old
            implementations).

         4. Removing some modules altogether without replacing them.

        To the best of our knowledge, with the exceptions noted below or
        within the files themselves, the files that constitute PyCrypto are in
        the public domain. Most are distributed with the following notice:

          The contents of this file are dedicated to the public domain. To
          the extent that dedication to the public domain is not available,
          everyone is granted a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free,

          contents of this file for any purpose whatsoever.
